// the eye stub's (native_preview_camera.cpp): its base, written so that each eye sits at the room's centre looking along a face. The phases, one tick a frame:
//   measure  nothing is aimed or held. Each eye's b1 rows are copied at its first scene draw (concourse_pane.cpp) and, once read back, the eyes' row 275 is set against the
//            store's camera of the same frame (the world check): past kWorldOffsetM the aim and the cube's origin move by render less store. No rows in kVrMeasureMaxTicks: the
//            store's centre, said so.
//   aim      each tick the next face not yet covered (cvb::AimPlan), B = G(H)^-1 * D from the latest head (concourse_vr_bake_core.h), the near value raised, and the runtime asked
//            to withhold kVrHoldLag frames (each tick, so the hold runs until kVrHoldLag frames after the last aim). Each eye's tonemap draw captures with that eye's own rows on
//            the GPU; the counts that come back mark a face covered, or have it aimed at again, up to cvb::kAimsPerFace times. A face never filled ends the bake anyway, said so.
// Every line starts "concourse bake: vr". What a piece that never ran leaves: no "vr: the bake is available" line (the stub, or the tone draw never seen); a begin and no "vr rows"
// lines and the finish line's "rows copied 0 0" (no scene draw's rows copied); "vr stub" lines with 0 calls (the stub never ran) or written 0x0 (it ran and wrote nothing); the
// finish line's "tone draws 0" (no tonemap draw while capturing), or its frames "not at the centre" (the aim did not land); the hold's line "NONE taken"; the near's line "not
