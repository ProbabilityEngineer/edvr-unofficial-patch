// The concourse's glass panes (docs\concourse-cull-2026-11-05.md, "The panes"). TEMPORARY. While the concourse cull is wanted (key or override on, on foot, in a
// station's social space, the anchor seen), the station's glass family is treated, and the outside is not drawn while the cull is on: the plume and its twin, which
// paint over the panes, and the smoke, ship lasers, engine trails, atmosphere and planet (concourse_cull_core.h, kWithheldPs and kWithheldVs), whatever the mode. The glass family is named by its vertex shader (concourse_cull_core.h, kPaneFamilyVs) and a pixel shader: kPaneFamilyPs, or any pixel
// shader whose layout is the glass's (concourse_glass_layout.h; the game builds one per Material Quality level, learned as each is created by concoursePaneNoteShader), any index count;
// diag.concourse_panes adds entries. The game's own glass draw is always issued, unchanged; the treatment is a SECOND draw of
// the same arguments, right after it, that paints the pane over. The modes (diag.concourse_pane_mode, F4):
//   mirror       the second draw is the game's shader with three stand-in textures (t8, t9, t10), opaque (RGB only), writing depth
//   mirror-soft  mirror, and the pixel shader's constant buffer 2 replaced by EDVR's own (roughness scaled to 0.54)
//   tint         the second draw is a white pixel shader and a blend-factor colour per index count, opaque, so each window type can be told apart by eye
//   off          the game's own glass, unchanged
//   mirror-backdrop  mirror-steady's one opaque pass, with a pixel shader that samples a cube of view directions captured on a key press (PROTOTYPE, the end of this header)
// While the cull is on (the plain phase), the second draw is limited to the pixels whose scene behind the pane is farther than diag.concourse_mirror_beyond
// metres: a mark pass (one fullscreen triangle at that depth, writing stencil bit 0x40 where the scene is farther) runs once a frame before the first mirror
// draw, and the mirror draw tests that bit. Glass with a wall behind it (a terminal screen) is left as the game drew it. Each pane's side, learned by two
// occlusion queries (the game's glass samples, the mirror's samples), decides which panes still mirror once the cull is lifted (the bay window clearing).
// Family draws are also measured: an occlusion query around the game's draw gives the share of the viewport it covers, whatever the mode.
//
// The draw thunks of vscreen.cpp (hookedDraw and hookedDrawInstanced for what is withheld; hookedDrawIndexed and hookedDrawIndexedInstanced for that and the
// mirror; the flat branch and the VR path of each) build one ConcoursePaneScope around the
// real draw call, skip the real call when withheld() says so, and issue the second draw when nextMirrorPass() says so. With nothing armed the scope is one
// relaxed atomic load, and nextMirrorPass() is a check of one member that is false for every draw that is not the family's.
