// Finding, fetching and adopting an update. Logic only: no window, and every
// request goes through an HttpClient, so tools\launcher_test can script GitHub.
//
// The rules (docs\design-launcher-2026-11-07.md, "Updates"):
//   * Nothing here ever blocks a launch. A transport failure, a 403, a 429 or a
//     5xx is Skipped, with a sentence for the log, and the next launch tries again.
//   * A release is offered only if it carries a signed manifest that verifies
//     under a key built into the exe. A release that fails any check is Refused,
//     is not offered, and does not fall back to an older release.
//   * Digests, not tags, decide "up to date": a release re-cut under the same
//     tag has a different manifest digest.
//   * `issued` only goes up: a verified manifest older than the highest one
//     already accepted is ignored, so a hijacked account cannot roll users back.
//   * Nothing is downloaded but the manifest and its signature until the caller
//     asks for downloadUpdate, and nothing about the install changes until
//     commitManifest.
