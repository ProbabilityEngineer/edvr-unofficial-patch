// What the launcher's window does besides installing: loading the payload, asking GitHub
// about an update, fetching it, switching to it, and starting and watching the game.
//
// Everything slow runs on a worker thread and reports back through `post`, which runs a
// job on the window's thread: the window never waits, and nothing here touches a control.
// All state lives on that one thread. The class owns no HWND, so tools\launcher_test drives
// it with a queue standing in for the message loop, a scripted GitHub, and fake programs.
//
// Nothing downloads or changes until the user presses Update (beginUpdate), and a failure to
// reach GitHub is one quiet line, never a dialog.
