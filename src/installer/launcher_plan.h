// Applying an install from a short-lived elevated copy of the launcher.
//
// The launcher itself never runs elevated: the game must never start from an elevated
// process, and a window that can start the game has no business holding administrator
// rights. When a game folder needs them (it is usually under Program Files) the launcher
// writes what it decided to a plan file, starts a copy of itself with `runas` and
// `--apply-plan <file>`, waits, and reads the result file the copy wrote.
//
// The elevated copy shows no window and trusts nothing the file says beyond the choices it
// records. It re-verifies the manifest's signature and every payload file's hash itself,
// surveys the folder again, plans again and applies that plan.
//
// The file names no path the copy writes to or installs from. Any program running as the
// user could write a plan and start the copy, and the permission prompt would name this
// launcher, so a path in the file would let that program write anywhere as administrator.
// The copy works every path out from where the plan file is (planPathsFor): the result
// beside it, the manifest and the payload cache under the same data root, and the settings
// mirror from the game folder and that root. It installs only a signed download, never a
// --payload folder.
//
// Both files are one `key=value` per line in UTF-8, written atomically. A line it does not
// know, a value with a line break in it, or a missing key makes the reader refuse the file.
