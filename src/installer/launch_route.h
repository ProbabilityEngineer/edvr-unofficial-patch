// Starting the game through EDLaunch, and watching until it is over.
//
// This is the route every store can use (docs\design-launcher-2026-11-07.md, "The EDLaunch
// route"):
//
//   Steam      steam://rungameid/359320
//   Epic       com.epicgames.launcher://apps/<app>?action=launch&silent=true
//   Frontier   EDLaunch.exe /autorun /autoquit /edo /vr   (or /novr)
//
// EDLaunch is left running by /autoquit often enough that the launcher watches for the game,
// and when the game has exited it asks EDLaunch's windows to close with WM_CLOSE. It never
// terminates a process. If the game never starts, EDLaunch is probably patching it, and is
// left alone.
//
// Nothing here starts anything by itself: a route is data, startRoute does the starting
// through RouteOps, and tools\launcher_test supplies ops that record instead of act, so the
// strings can be checked without a launcher ever being started.
