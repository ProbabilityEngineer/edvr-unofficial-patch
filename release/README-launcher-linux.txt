ED-UP launcher on Linux (Steam + Proton)

This is new and untested on Linux. The launcher window, its updates and the
Play button may not work yet. Logs and reports are welcome.

What it is: the ED-UP launcher, the same Windows program people run on
Windows. It runs inside Elite's own Proton setup, so there is nothing
else to install. It needs Python 3 and the Proton that Steam already uses for
Elite. It does not need Protontricks or a system Wine.

Run Elite once from Steam, then close it. If you change Elite's Proton version
in Steam, launch Elite once again first. On Steam Deck, use Desktop Mode. Run
as your normal user, without sudo:

    ./ed-up-launcher.sh

To see what would run without starting anything or writing any files:

    ./ed-up-launcher.sh --dry-run

Options for the launcher itself go after a lone --, for example:

    ./ed-up-launcher.sh -- --channel rc

The wrapper's own options (--game-dir, --steam-dir, --proton, --launcher-exe)
go before the --. They work as they do for the Linux installer wrapper: use
--game-dir '/path/to/product' for a different product folder, --steam-dir
'/path/to/Steam' or STEAM_DIR for a nonstandard Steam root, and --proton
'/path/to/Proton' if the prefix record is missing or stale. The shell script
works from any directory. You can also run python3 ed-up-launcher-linux.py
--launcher directly.

The launcher keeps its downloads and settings inside Elite's Proton prefix, in
drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/EDVR under
steamapps/compatdata/359320/pfx.

Play starts Elite through Steam. Starting Elite directly, without Steam, is not
offered on Linux yet.

Keep any existing required Elite launch options. Headset and OpenXR setup and
Proton gameplay are not covered by this package.
